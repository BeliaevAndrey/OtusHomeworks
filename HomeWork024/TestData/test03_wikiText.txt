In computer science, the Boyer-Moore string-search algorithm is an
efficient string-searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark
for practical string-search literature.[1] It was developed by
Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977.[2] The original paper
contained static tables for computing the pattern shifts without an
explanation of how to produce them. The algorithm for producing the
tables was published in a follow-on paper; this paper contained errors
which were later corrected by Wojciech Rytter in 1980.[3][4]

The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for (the pattern),
but not the string being searched in (the text). It is thus well-suited
for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or
where it persists across multiple searches. The Boyer-Moore algorithm
uses information gathered during the preprocess step to skip sections
of the text, resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string
search algorithms. In general, the algorithm runs faster as the pattern
length increases. The key features of the algorithm are to match on the
tail of the pattern rather than the head, and to skip along the text in
jumps of multiple characters rather than searching every single character
in the text.
